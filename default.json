You and your tribe can build bases, however, randomly leaving turrets\n\n and bullshit foundation spam around the map will result \n\nin structure wipe for tribe. If you build FOB, demo it when you are done.\n\n Don't build in a cave unless you plan on living there.\n\n\n3. Don't be toxic. Yes, you can use profanity and fuck with people in global, \n\nbut it must be in moderation and just shit talk banter. \n\nDropping racial stuff in global because you are edgey, \n\nwill get you kicked.\n\n\n Alternatively, we may have a server event where we give all of your enemies \n\nrockets to remove you.\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEM GETTING CURSOR TO CLOSE THIS WINDOW, try alt+tab.",

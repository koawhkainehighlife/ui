You and your tribe can build bases, however, randomly leaving turrets and bullshit foundation spam \n\naround the map will result in structure wipe for tribe. If you build FOB, demo it when you are done.\n\n Don't build in a cave unless you plan on living there.\n\n\n3. Don't be toxic. Yes, you can use profanity and fuck with people in global, but it must be in moderation\n\n and just shit talk banter. Dropping racial stuff in global because you are edgey, will get you kicked.\n\n\n IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEM GETTING CURSOR TO CLOSE THIS WINDOWS, try alt+tab. \n \n\n .",
          "text2": "Character Levels= 135. Pending another config fuckup, this should not change.\n\nAt first you might be annoyed about the player health and/or the melee damage stat. \n\nPlease understand, there is an imbue bench that gives people 755% tools and pike. \n\nAs a result our balance is strongly weighted against what you can do with those max capped items.Dino Max Level wild is currently 300.\n\nWith the Primal Chaos Mod, we are still working out balancing.\n\n I will apologize in advance, in case you wake up one day and the dinos are 150.",
